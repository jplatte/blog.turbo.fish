Procedural macros (often shortened to 'proc-macros') are a unique Rust feature
that allow creating custom derives, attributes and function-like macros in
regular Rust code that is run at compile time. And although they are the only
way of writing custom attributes and derives, vastly more powerful and even
easier to read than (large) declarative macros, there is very little learning
material out there for proc-macros.

That's why I'm here, writing my own blog series (as you could probably tell
from the title) on the matter. Currently, I plan to write 5 more posts after
this one, starting with a very basic derive example that should appear within a
weel or two, continuing with a discussion on proc-macro error handling and then
moving to topics only applicable to smaller subsets of proc-macros.

## Anatomy of a procedural macro

Procedural macros are functions with a `#[proc_macro]`,
`#[proc_macro_derive(Name)]` or `#[proc_macro_attribute]` attribute. They have
one (function-like and derive macros) or two (attribute macros)
`proc_macro::TokenStream` arguments and also return a `proc_macro::TokenStream`.

â€” [The Rust Reference][ref]

They must be public (`pub fn ...`) and live in a crate of the type `proc-macro`.
When using Cargo (and who doesn't?) this crate type is declared
in the `lib` section of `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[lib]
proc-macro = true
```

A proc-macro crate can *only* export proc-macros, no regular functions, types,
modules or `macro_rules!` macros. It can of course define other items, but it
cannot export them for use in other crates.

## The crates involved

Every proc-macro crate can access the builtin [`proc_macro` crate][proc_macro].
There is not much to say about it; the only type from it that a typical
proc-macro interacts with is `proc_macro::TokenStream`.

All of the following articles are going to be about proc-macros that parse their
input with [syn] and produce their output with [quote]. These are not mandatory
for proc-macros, but they are used by the vast majority of them.

[syn]: https://docs.rs/syn/1.0
[quote]: https://docs.rs/quote/1.0

## Derive macros vs. other procedural macros

*derives add code, other macros rewrite code*

## A note on macro expansion

*all macros, including procedural ones, run before type checking or resolution!*
