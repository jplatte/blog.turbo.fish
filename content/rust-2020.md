This is my personal wishlist of things I'd like to see in 2020 relating to Rust.
It only contains technical items, not because I disagree with the people who say
we should prioritize some non-technical things, but because I feel like I don't
have much of value to add to that topic.[^1]

### Generics

My absolute top one wishlist feature: const generics. The language I'm most
proficient in other than Rust is C++ and its equivalent feature (with the
*beautiful* name of 'non-type template parameters') is one of the only things I
miss in Rust from time to time. And while most of the things I'd like to do with
it can be done using [typenum][], it can result in quite long type
names, which makes error messages including those types very hard to read.[^2]

I'd also love to see [GATs][gat] coming to nightly next year. Since they are
required for `async fn` in traits, I have my hopes up for this happening. Then
again, `async fn` is a [really hard problem](async-fn) even with GATs available,
so they might not get prioritized until the path forward is clearer. Either way,
I'd love to play around with them.

### Cargo features

There's a [few][cargo-1] [long-standing][cargo-2] [issues][cargo-3]
[in][cargo-4] [cargo][cargo-5] that all relate to the idea of *one* feature-set
per (transitive) dependency. On first thought, it seems reasonable to require
tests to run with dependencies compiled with the same feature set that's used
when distributing your app or library as a release build. However, once you
consider build scripts and `no_std`, this doesn't work so well anymore.

A prime example of this issue is serde_json, which has a hard dependency on
std, purely because `dev-dependencies` and regular dependencies have their
features unified (see [serde/json#516][json-pr]). There's of course a reason
that these issues have been open for so long, and that is that it would require
a big rewrite of some parts of cargo. I don't know what needs to happen for this
rewrite to start, but I'd love to see (some of) these issues finally being
resolved in 2020.

Another unfortunate thing about cargo features is that enabling a feature of an
optional dependency also enables that dependency ([rust-lang/cargo#3494][3494]).
AFAICT, solving this doesn't require any big rewrites, just a consensus on which
way to solve it.

### IDE experience

This one didn't make it into the title, but I'd nevertheless like to see the IDE
experience improve further. RLS is already more useful than Microsoft's C/C++
extension in Visual Studio Code, but some things seem like they are still
somewhat far away from their possible best: edit-to-feedback time,
autocompletion, and finding item definitions on mouseover are all things I'd
like to see improved next year (and I think they will be).

### Conclusion

Most people reading this will already have come across const generics, GATs as
well as the cargo and RLS issues I wrote about. I didn't write about new ideas
I think should be tried out, because I think Rust doesn't need these kinds of
changes at the moment. I agree with the previous Rust 2020 blog posts that
called for another year of maturity. Let's leave the anonymous records; effects;
linear, dependent and higher-kinded types and whatever else for later.

Thanks for reading!
