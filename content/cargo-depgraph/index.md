`cargo-depgraph` is a cargo plugin that generates [DOT][] code for cargo-enabled
Rust projects' dependency graphs. This code is usually fed directly to `dot`,
which then generates a png, svg or whatever else you want from it.

[DOT]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)

If you're a redditor and frequenting [/r/rust][], you might have seen my
announcemment of cargo-depgraph two weeks ago. Since the initial announcement,
I have extended it quite a bit, and I now consider it the go-to tool when you
want to have a closer look at your dependency graph.

## Enough with the talking!

Let's start with a small dependency graph, `rand`s:
